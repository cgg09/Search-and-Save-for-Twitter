In this folder there are two more files:
* The database, which is generated automatically by the program.
* A properties file ("client.properties") with the consumer_key, consumer_secret and the base_callback_url. It is required to create this file.

An example of the "client.properties" file would be this one:

consumer_key=***********************
consumer_secret=**************************
base_callback_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/TFG/twitter_callback
